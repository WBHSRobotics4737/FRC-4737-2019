# FRC-4737-2019
The 2019 robot code for FRC



## How to contribute
### Setup
First, make sure you have the latest development environment.
You can find instructions [here](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc).

If you haven't already, clone this repository to your computer. If you're unsure how to properly use Github, ask someone who knows.

### Completing Trello tasks

If you want to change or add code to complete a task, create a new branch with a meaningful name. Make sure you stem from the master branch.
Create a pull request after you've committed all your changes and the task is complete.

### Managing code during competition

When at a competition event, only one person should be modifying the code. There won't be enough time to manage branches for changes.
